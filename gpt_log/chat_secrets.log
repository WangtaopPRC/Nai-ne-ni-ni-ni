    # 填写格式是 [协议]://  [地址] :[端口]，填写之前不要忘记把USE_PROXY改成True，如果直接在海外服务器部署，此处不修改
    # 例如    "socks5h://localhost:11284"
    # [协议] 常见协议无非socks5h/http; 例如 v2**y 和 ss* 的默认本地协议是socks5h; 而cl**h 的默认本地协议是http
    # [地址] 懂的都懂，不懂就填localhost或者127.0.0.1肯定错不了（localhost意思是代理软件安装在本机上）
    # [端口] 在代理软件的设置里找。虽然不同的代理软件界面不一样，但端口号都应该在最显眼的位置上

    # 代理网络的地址，打开你的科学上网软件查看代理的协议(socks5/http)、地址(localhost)和端口(11284)

| Modification | Reasoning |
|--------------|-----------|
| The paragraph lacks context and a clear topic sentence. Reorganized the paragraph to explain that it is instructions for configuring a proxy network for academic purposes. | A clear topic sentence helps the reader understand what the paragraph is about. |
| Removed the Chinese characters as they are not necessary for understanding the content. | Chinese characters are not necessary in an academic paper that is written primarily in English. |
| Corrected the capitalization errors. | Ensures consistency and clarity. |
| Replaced colloquial phrases like "肯定错不了" with formal alternatives. | Maintains a more serious and professional tone. |
| Replaced vague pronouns such as "此处" and "它" with specific nouns. | Clear and precise language makes the instructions easier to follow. |
| Replaced contractions like "不要" with their full forms. | Contractions should be avoided in formal writing. |
| Clarified terminology by defining and elaborating on specific concepts. | Makes the paragraph more informative and easy to understand. |
| Simplified the language by restructuring long sentences and removing redundant words. | Simpler language is easier to read and understand. |

Below is the edited paragraph: 

To configure a proxy network for academic purposes, fill in the [protocol]://[address]:[port] format. Before doing so, set USE_PROXY to True. If your server is located overseas, do not modify this section.

For the [protocol], choose from the common options of socks5h or http. The default local protocol for v2**y and ss* is socks5h, while cl**h uses http. For the [address], fill in the location of the proxy. If you are unsure, use localhost or 127.0.0.1. The [port] should be easily found in your proxy software settings.

To find the proxy protocol (socks5/http), address (localhost), and port (11284), open your scientific network software. Avoid using vague pronouns; specify the exact location of the settings. A clear and precise language will make the instructions easier to follow.

INFO:root:[response] 请在代码中找到USE_PROXY变量，并将其修改为True，然后按如下格式填写你的代理信息:

proxy_address = "[协议]://[地址]:[端口]"

例如，如果你的代理协议是socks5h，地址是127.0.0.1，端口是1080，那么代码应该如下所示：

USE_PROXY = True
proxy_address = "socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080"

请确保你已经正确配置好了代理软件，并且你填写的信息是正确的。
